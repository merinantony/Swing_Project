# Swing_Project

Swing is a GUI widget toolkit for Java.[1] It is part of Oracle's Java Foundation Classes (JFC) â€“ an API for providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for Java programs.

Swing was developed to provide a more sophisticated set of GUI components than the earlier Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT).
Swing provides a look and feel that emulates the look and feel of several platforms, and also supports a 
pluggable look and feel that allows applications to have a look and feel unrelated to the underlying platform.
It has more powerful and flexible components than AWT.
